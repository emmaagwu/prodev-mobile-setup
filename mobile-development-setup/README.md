# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Objective
The goal of this task is to set up a mobile development environment using **Expo Framework** for React Native. Expo simplifies mobile app development by providing tools that allow developers to test and run applications seamlessly on physical devices without relying heavily on emulators.

---

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Node.js (LTS version)**
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows OS**
- A physical mobile device (Android or iOS)

---

## Why Expo Go?
Traditional mobile development often requires powerful machines to run emulators for different devices and operating systems. Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by enabling developers to:

- Test apps directly on physical devices.
- Support both Android and iOS seamlessly.
- Avoid the complexity of managing multiple emulators.
